A special version of the Non-Metric Space Library (NMSLIB)
=================
This modification of NMSLIB is based on release is [1.5.3](https://github.com/searchivarius/nmslib/releases/tag/v1.5.3)
-----------------

This version of NMSLIB contains additional custom spaces and several modified search methods. However, this branch uses a somewhat different codebased than a codebased employed in our paper:

[L. Boytsov, D. Novak, Y. Malkov, E. Nyberg  (2016). *Off the Beaten Path: Letâ€™s Replace Term-Based Retrieval
with k-NN Search*, to appear in proceedings CIKM'16](http://boytsov.info/pubs/cikm2016.pdf).

Note that the Java code and scripts are hosted in [knn4qa](https://github.com/oaqa/knn4qa/tree/bigger_reruns/scripts) repository of the OAQA group, branch **bigger_reruns**.
