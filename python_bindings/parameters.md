Basic parameter tuning for NMSLIB
=======

#### Graph-based search methods: SW-graph and HNSW

The basic guidelines are similar for both methods. Specifically, increasing the
value of ``efConstruction`` improves the quality of a constructed graph and leads
to higher accuracy of search. However this also leads to longer indexing times.
Similarly, increasing the value of ``efSearch`` improves recall at the expense of
longer retrieval time. The reasonable range of values for these parameters is
100-2000. In HNSW, there is a parameter ``ef``, which is merely an alias for the 
parameter ``efSearch``.

The recall values are also affected by parameters ``NN`` (for SW-graph) and ``M``
(HNSW). Increasing the values of these parameters (to a certain degree) leads to
better recall and shorter retrieval times (at the expense of longer indexing time).
For low and moderate recall values (e.g., 60-80%) increasing these parameters
may lead to longer retrieval times. The reasonable range of values for these
parameters is 5-100.

In what follows, we discuss HNSW-specific parameters. 
First, for HNSW, the parameter ``M`` defines the maximum number of neighbors in the 
zero and above-zero layers. However, the actual default maximum number of neighbors 
for the zero layer is 2*``MM``. This behavior can be overriden by explicitly
setting the maximum number of neighbors for the zero (``maxM0``) and
above-zero layers (``maxM``). Note that the zero layer contains all the data
points, but the number of points included in other layers is defined by the parameter 
``mult`` (see the HNSW paper for details).

Second, there is a trade-off between retrieval performance and indexing time 
related to the choice of the pruning heuristic (controlled
by the parameter ``delaunay_type``). Specifically, by default ``delaunay_type`` is
equal to 1. Using delaunay type=1 improves performanceâ€”especially at high
recall values (> 80%) at the expense of longer indexing times. Therefore, for
lower recall values, we recommend using ``delaunay_type=0``.

Third, HNSW has the parameter ``post``, which defines the amount (and type) of 
postprocessing applied to the constructed graph. The default value is 0, which means 
non postprocessing. Additional options are 1 and 2 (2 means more postprocessing).

Fourth, there is a pesky design descision that an index does not necessarily
contain the data points, which are loaded separately. HNSW, chooses
to include data points into the index in several important cases, which include
the dense spaces for the Euclidean and the cosine distance. These optimized indices
are created automatically whenever possible. However, this behavior can be
overriden by setting the parameter ``skip_optimized_index`` to 1.
